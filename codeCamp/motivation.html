		<p>Thousands of smart students, especially financially underprivileged students, have been failed by the decay in Nigeria's educational system. Most students remain unexposed to challenging projects that would enhance critical thinking and maximize their potential. To solve this problem, we have decided to organize a programming bootcamp, where the best and brightest students from across different secondary schools can benefit from an enriching and stimulating educational experience. We believe in the transformative power of computer programming, and have organized this rigorous program to enhance critical thinking, and offer students a quicker path towards self-employment and entreprenurship. Code Camp 2015 could potentially spark the interest of the participants in software development, and thus create a channel for grooming leaders that would place Nigeria in it's rightful place as a leader in this age of digital revolution. </p>
